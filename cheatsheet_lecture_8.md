## Normal Distribution

  > Normal distribution can fit several real life numerical population.

  > The normal or Gaussian distribution is a continuous function that looks like the following:

  Where mmu is the E(X) and sigma squared is V(X).

  > The standard variation stretches the distribution horizontally while the expected value shift the curve completely horizontally.
