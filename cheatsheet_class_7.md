## Continuous Random Variable

  > Continuous RVs are variable that are not discrete. Meaning they can be part of a non-countable set or an infinite set.

  > There are 2 contition that a random RV must respect:
	
	1. We express possible values a continuous RV can take with an interval. For instance: a <= x <= b for a,b,x E Real Numbers
	
	2. P(X = c) = 0 for any number that is a possible value of X.

## Probability Distribution Function

  > We now introduce Continuous Probability Distributions. Just like before, they allow us to determine what are the probabilities that X equal to c. The main differencehere is that the intervals are infinite (since x can take any values).

  > Since this is a continuous fucntion, x can take any values.

  > If we now require the density function [ P(a <= X <= b) ] we can take the integral of the function where the boundaries are a (lower) and b (upper). Since we use continuous RV, P(a < X < b) == P(a <= X <= b).
